# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 (0.17%) are fraudulent.Each transaction has 30 features, all of which are numerical. The features V1, V2, ..., V28 are the result of a PCA transformation. The Time feature contains the time elapsed since the first transaction, and the Amount feature contains the transaction amount. The response variable, Class, is 1 in the case of fraud, and 0 otherwise.
Our goal in this project is to construct models to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent.
